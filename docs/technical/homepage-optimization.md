# Homepage Performance Optimization

## Issues Identified

1. **Multiple Analytics Calls**: The homepage was making duplicate analytics tracking calls
2. **401 Unauthorized Errors**: Analytics tracking was failing for non-authenticated users on public pages
3. **Duplicate API Requests**: Multiple components were making the same API calls simultaneously
4. **Multiple MongoDB Connections**: Each API call was triggering a new MongoDB connection attempt

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Analytics Tracking Consolidation
- **Problem**: Two separate useEffect hooks were tracking analytics on the homepage
- **Solution**: Consolidated into a single analytics tracking effect that only runs when user is authenticated
- **Result**: Eliminated duplicate analytics calls and 401 errors for non-authenticated users

### 2. Request Deduplication
- **Problem**: Multiple components making identical API requests simultaneously
- **Solution**: Implemented `deduplicatedFetch` utility that caches and reuses pending requests within a 1-second window
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `/lib/request-deduplication.ts`
  - Updated `fetchWithCache` to use `deduplicatedFetch`
  - Updated `DailyUpdatesCarousel` to use `deduplicatedFetch`
- **Result**: Identical API requests are now deduplicated automatically

### 3. MongoDB Connection Pooling
- **Problem**: Multiple simultaneous API calls were each attempting to create new MongoDB connections
- **Solution**: Enhanced MongoDB connection logic with a `connectionPromise` to ensure only one connection attempt at a time
- **Result**: Reduced MongoDB connection attempts and improved connection stability

### 4. Component Optimization
- **Problem**: `DailyUpdatesCarousel` was re-fetching data when its state changed due to dependency array issues
- **Solution**: Removed `updates.length` from the `fetchData` dependency array to prevent re-fetch loops
- **Result**: Eliminated unnecessary API calls when component state changes

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced API Calls**: From multiple duplicate calls to single deduplicated requests
2. **Faster Page Load**: Eliminated redundant MongoDB connections and API requests
3. **Better Error Handling**: No more 401 errors for public page visitors
4. **Improved Stability**: Connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Authentication-Aware Analytics**: Only track analytics for authenticated users
2. **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate API calls at the network level
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections in development
4. **Proper React Dependencies**: Avoid re-fetch loops in useEffect hooks

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a global state management solution (Redux/Zustand) to share data between components
2. Add request caching with proper cache invalidation strategies
3. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates instead of polling
4. Consider server-side rendering (SSR) for public pages to improve initial load time
