# Performance Optimization Summary

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to address MongoDB connection issues and API performance problems.

## Issues Identified

From the logs, we identified several critical issues:

1. **MongoDB Query Performance**:
   - Homepage data aggregation was taking ~1500ms
   - Project data aggregation was taking ~1500-1700ms
   - Response sizes were extremely large (3.6MB for homepage data, 2.5MB for project data)

2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**:
   - Frequent connection checkouts for each API request
   - Connection pool information not properly tracked

3. **Data Inefficiency**:
   - No field projections to limit data returned
   - No caching for frequently accessed data
   - Redundant database queries

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Server-side Caching

Created a robust memory cache system:
- Added `lib/cache.ts` with TTL support and namespace management
- Implemented cache statistics tracking
- Implemented cache invalidation API endpoints
- Cache times optimized for different data types:
  - Homepage data: 2 minutes
  - Project data: 2 minutes
  - Task data: 5 minutes

### 2. MongoDB Connection Pooling

Enhanced connection management:
- Increased minPoolSize from 3 to 5 to keep more connections ready
- Added maxIdleTimeMS (2 minutes) to properly release idle connections
- Fixed connection reuse tracking
- Added comprehensive connection pool monitoring
- Prevented duplicate connection monitoring setups

### 3. Collection Access Optimization

Improved database collection access:
- Added collection caching to avoid repeated lookups
- Created optimized getCollection method with local caching

### 4. Query Optimization

Completely rewrote key database queries:
- Replaced complex aggregation pipelines with simpler, more efficient queries
- Added field projections to reduce data transfer (excluding description and images)
- Implemented parallel database queries with Promise.all
- Removed unused/redundant nested lookups

### 5. API Response Optimization

Improved API response handling:
- Added client-side cache headers with stale-while-revalidate
- Reduced response payload sizes
- Added proper error handling
- Created cache control endpoints for admin use

### 6. Debugging Tools

Added enhanced diagnostic capabilities:
- Created detailed performance tracking with checkpoints
- Added memory usage tracking
- Added cache hit/miss statistics
- Created test script for benchmarking API performance

## Expected Improvements

These optimizations should result in:

1. **Performance**:
   - Homepage data: ~1500ms → ~100-200ms (after caching)
   - Project data: ~1700ms → ~100-200ms (after caching)
   - First request still benefits from optimized queries (~500-700ms)

2. **Connection Management**:
   - Significantly reduced connection creation
   - Proper connection reuse
   - Better handling of connection pool limits

3. **Data Efficiency**:
   - Reduced data transfer sizes (50-70% smaller responses)
   - Elimination of duplicate queries
   - Faster client rendering due to smaller payload

## Monitoring and Future Improvements

Continue monitoring:
1. Cache hit rates to fine-tune TTL values
2. Connection pool usage
3. Memory usage for the server-side cache

Consider additional improvements:
1. Add Redis for distributed caching if needed for scaling
2. Implement database schema indexing for frequently queried fields
3. Add data compression for API responses
