# Deployment Guide for EyeTask

## üöÄ Netlify Deployment

### What Was Fixed

Your app was failing on Netlify because it was using **file-based JSON storage** which doesn't work in serverless environments. Here's what we changed:

#### 1. Database Layer Abstraction
- Created `lib/database.ts` with an in-memory database that works in serverless environments
- Updated `lib/data.ts` to use the new database abstraction instead of file system operations
- All data is now stored in memory and resets with each function invocation

#### 2. Netlify Configuration
- Added `netlify.toml` with proper Next.js plugin configuration
- Updated `next.config.ts` for serverless compatibility
- Removed file system dependencies

#### 3. Build Optimizations
- Fixed TypeScript build errors
- Optimized webpack for serverless functions
- Added proper headers for API routes

### Current Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The current setup uses **in-memory storage** which means:
- Data resets when the serverless function restarts
- No persistent storage between sessions
- Good for testing and MVP, but not for production use

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment with in-memory database"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the Next.js configuration
   - Deploy with these settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Add any environment variables in Netlify dashboard
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret key
   - `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to `info` for production

### Testing the Deployment

After deployment, test these features:
- ‚úÖ Login to admin dashboard (`/admin`)
- ‚úÖ Create new projects
- ‚úÖ Create new tasks
- ‚úÖ View public project pages

Default login credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## üîß Production Upgrade Options

For a production deployment with persistent data, consider these options:

### Option 1: External Database (Recommended)
```bash
# Install database dependencies
npm install @planetscale/database  # or
npm install @supabase/supabase-js  # or
npm install mongodb
```

### Option 2: Netlify Blob Storage
```bash
npm install @netlify/blobs
```

### Option 3: External Storage API
Use services like:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- PlanetScale (MySQL)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Firebase Firestore

## üìù Current Status

‚úÖ **Working**:
- Authentication
- Admin dashboard
- CRUD operations for projects/tasks/subtasks
- Public project viewing
- Responsive design
- Hebrew/English font support

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:
- Data is not persistent (resets on function restart)
- No file uploads (images)
- No real-time updates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **500 Error on API calls**:
   - Check function logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check if API routes are working locally first

2. **Data not persisting**:
   - This is expected with the current in-memory setup
   - Upgrade to a proper database for persistence

3. **Build failures**:
   - Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility (18+)

### Debugging

Check Netlify function logs:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Functions" tab
3. Click on any function to see logs
4. Look for error messages

### Local Testing

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to test all functionality.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test all functionality on your deployed site
2. **Short-term**: Implement proper database storage
3. **Long-term**: Add file upload functionality for task images
